Parameters:
- Topic: {topic}
- Intention: {intention}
- Theme: {theme}
- Content: {content}

Task:
Generate 5â€“7 creative prompts that match the topic, intention, theme and content.
These prompts should:
- Be written as a full instruction, not just a short idea
- The prompts should explain what to create, in a way that is highly descriptive and specific
- The prompt must be relevant to the given intention only. For example, if the intention is "short-form video", the prompt should be suitable for a short-form video
- Be suitable for various content formats (e.g., short-form videos, social posts, blogs, ads and more)
- Be concise and engaging
- Work directly for content creation (e.g. videos, posts, blogs)
- Be phrased as instructions or hooks, not explanations
- Avoid greetings, hashtags, and meta-text
- Include specific details from the content to make prompts more relevant but do not copy the content verbatim
- If content is not provided, focus on the topic, intention, and theme to create relevant prompts
- If you cannot generate prompts based on the input, generate generic prompts related to the topic and intention.

Output Format:
Return the list as plain text in this style:
1. [Prompt text]
2. [Prompt text]
3. [Prompt text]
